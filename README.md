# CUnits

CUnits is a single-page app that displays conversions from one unit of measurement to other frequently-used units, as well as some aspect ratios. The converted values can be individually copied to the clipboard by means of keyboard shortcuts. 

NOTE: Switch to Vimium's ["insert mode"](https://groups.google.com/g/vimium-dev/c/FHgfwW7Zl9A?pli=1) to use hot keys without conflict.
