# CUnits

Cunits is the source code for UnitSwitch, a single-page app that displays conversions from one unit of measurement to other frequently-used units, as well as some aspect ratios. Keyboard shortcuts are available to copy the desired conversion value to the clipboard.

NOTE: Switch to Vimium's ["insert mode"](https://groups.google.com/g/vimium-dev/c/FHgfwW7Zl9A?pli=1) to use hot keys without conflict.
